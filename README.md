# DBLJobBoard
DB Languages Job Board sample.
DB Languages is the name of my wife's business (translations) and I am slowly creating this platform for her and for my learing path.

This code is a tiny website that contains only HTMl and CSS (for now).
The purpose of it is to represent one of my Portfolios' projects, in order to find a job as a junior web developer.
